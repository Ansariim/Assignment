             <h2> Biography </h2>
         <p>  <strong> Bhagat Singh </strong> (28 September 1907 - 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who 
            participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation 
            for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the
            Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic
            coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region,
             and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.
